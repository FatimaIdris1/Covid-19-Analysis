# COVID-19 Data Analysis

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on the global spread and impact of COVID-19. The project explores confirmed cases, deaths, and recovery statistics using Python data analysis and visualization libraries. After an initial overview of global trends, the analysis zooms in on Nigeria to provide a more detailed understanding of the pandemic's effects within the country. The notebook offers insights into trends and patterns that shaped both the global and Nigerian COVID-19 response.

## Project Objectives

- Load and clean COVID-19 datasets.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on global and country-specific trends.
- Visualize the progression of the pandemic using plots.
- Highlight countries with the highest cases and death rates.
- Provide focused insights into the spread and impact of COVID-19 in Nigeria.


## Technologies Used

- Python 3.9+
- Pandas – for data manipulation
- NumPy – for numerical operations
- Matplotlib & Seaborn – for data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook – for interactive analysis

## Dataset

The datasets used for this analysis include time series data for:

- Confirmed COVID-19 cases
- Deaths
- Recoveries
